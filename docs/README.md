## Vision

A D&D tabletop application with AI-powered Dungeon Masters that deliver authentic, engaging gameplay. The DM has pluggable personas (Spencer Crittenden-style improv, classic epic narrator, etc.), maintains a canonical world model as source of truth, and adapts to player style.

## Key Features

- **Pluggable DM Personas** - Different AI personalities for different play styles
- **Canonical World Model** - Single source of truth for world state
- **D&D 5e SRD Rules** - Accurate mechanical resolution
- **Procedural Generation** - Balanced content creation
- **Extensible Architecture** - Designed for future game systems

## Current Status

**Phase 3: Game System Abstraction** ⬅️ IN PROGRESS

The project has completed core mechanics (combat, spells, leveling, death saves) and is now abstracting D&D 5e specifics to enable future extensibility.
